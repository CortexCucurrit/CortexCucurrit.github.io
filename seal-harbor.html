                            We are sorry to share the news that we need to reschedule our wedding due to COVID-19. The Governor of Maine has announced that through August 2020, there can be no gatherings of greater than 50 people and that anyone entering the state will be required to quarantine for 14 days. To comply with these guidelines and for the safety and health of all our friends and family, we are rescheduling our wedding to 2021. We apologize for the inconvenience, and we hope to see you at our rescheduled wedding celebration.<br /><br /><strong>Our new wedding date is July 31, 2021</strong>. Same schedule of events, same time, same place, same meal options, same guest list - just a different date!<br /><br />We are excited to celebrate with you as we take this big step together. We are getting married on Mount Desert Island in Maine, where Grace spent her childhood summers. These days, we spend as many spring and summer weekends as we can on Mount Desert, where we spend time with family hiking, boating, biking, and eating lots of lobster and blueberry pancakes. Mount Desert Island is a special place for us, and we are excited to share it with you!<br /><br />Mount Desert Island is home to Acadia National Park and is a popular summer vacation destination. <strong>We encourage our guests to book airfare, hotel rooms, and (if desired) rental cars as soon as possible</strong> due to high demand during the summer months. You can find more information about how to get to Mount Desert Island in the "Getting to Maine" section, and information about hotel blocks can be found in the "Accommodations" section. See you in Maine!

                <h2>Getting to Maine</h2>
                <hr class="my-4" />
                <h3>If you're coming from New England, we recommend you drive:</h3>
                <div class="text-left">
                    <p>Mount Desert Island is a five hour drive from Boston (four and a half if you drive like you're from Massachusetts...) If you have several extra hours, consider taking coastal route 1 between Brunswick and Ellsworth to see small town coastal Maine. When we drive up (usually after work on a Friday) we stop for dinner at <a href="https://highrollerlobster.com/" target="_blank">The Highroller Lobster Company</a> in Portland, Maine or <a href="http://www.quarrytaproom.com/" target="_blank">The Quarry Taproom</a> in Hallowell, Maine.</p>
                </div>
                <hr class="my-4" />
                <h3>If you plan to fly:</h3>
                <div class="text-left">
                    <p>The three major airports closest to Mount Desert Island are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bangor International Airport, 1 hour away from Mount Desert Island (<strong>we recommend using this airport</strong>)</li>
                        <li>The Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport, 5 minutes from Mount Desert Island</li>
                        <li>Boston Logan International Airport, 5 hours from Mount Desert Island</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If you plan to fly, we recommend that you fly into and out of Bangor International Airport. The Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport is closer to Mount Desert Island but sometimes unreliable; flights can be cancelled due to fog. If you fly into Boston, we recommend that you rent a car and drive the rest of the way to Maine (~5 hours).<br /><br />If you fly into Bangor, you should either rent a car (we recommend this option) or schedule airport transfers via the <a href="https://barharborshuttle.net/" target="_blank">Bar Harbor Shuttle</a>. Transfers must be scheduled at least 72 hours in advance (and we recommend calling weeks in advance as these seats fill up.)<br /><br />The Portland International Jetport in Portland, Maine and the Manchester-Boston regional airport are alternatives to the airports listed above. You should plan on renting a car and driving the remaining distance to the island if you opt for either of these airports.</p>

                <div class="text-left">
                    <p><a href="https://concordcoachlines.com/" target="_blank">Concord Coach</a> runs several buses a day between Boston's South Station and Bangor, which is an hour away from Mount Desert Island. To get to the island from Bangor, book a ride on the <a href="https://barharborshuttle.net/" target="_blank">Bar Harbor Shuttle</a> (we recommend calling several weeks in advance at least to reserve your seat.) More information on getting to the island by bus can be found <a href="https://www.exploreacadia.com/busbos.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

A Maine institution; Grace's grandfather brought her mom here on weekend mornings. We get the same order they did: the Pancake Club special with blueberry pancakes and real maple syrup.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-this-way-bar-harbor" target="_blank">Cafe This Way</a>, Bar Harbor. We recommend the omelets.</li>

                            <li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/choco-latte-bar-harbor" target="_blank">Choco-Latte</a>, Bar Harbor. Good breakfast and coffee to-go.</li>

                            <li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/jordan-pond-house-seal-harbor?osq=Restaurants" target="_blank">Jordan Pond House</a> Acadia National Park. Parking is difficult but this is an Acadia institution. Public transportation via the Island Explorer is available to Jordan Pond House. Ask for a table on the lawn as close to the water as possible. The clam chowder, cheese board, and popovers with prosecco are all good options. Reservations strongly recommended.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-travelin-lobster-bar-harbor?osq=Lobster" target="_blank">The Travelin Lobster</a>, Bar Harbor. The best lobster on the island. Outdoor seating only; bring bug juice. Owned by a Bar Harbor lobsterman, the lobster comes straight off his boat in the morning. We recommend finding a friend and ordering the lobster dinner for two (or you could just eat two lobsters...)</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/asticou-restaurant-northeast-harbor?osq=Restaurants" target="_blank">The Asticou Inn</a> porch, Northeast Harbor. Ask for a table on the porch with a view of the water; the lobster rolls are the best thing on the menu here. Reservations recommended.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/abels-lobster-pound-mount-desert-2" target="_blank">Abel's Lobster Pound</a>, Town of Mount Desert. A nicer dinner option that's good for those who want to eat lobster indoors with non-plastic silverware and a view of the water. Reservations required; ask for a table indoors with a view of the water. We recommend the blueberry pie a la mode for dessert.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-burning-tree-restaurant-mount-desert?osq=Restaurants" target="_blank">The Burning Tree</a>, Otter Creek. Maine farm-to-table; vegetables are grown in the restaurant's backyard and nearby farms. If they're offered, the squash blossoms are incredible. Reservations recommended.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/havana-bar-harbor?osq=Restaurants" target="_blank">Havana</a>, Bar Harbor. One of the nicest restaurants on Mount Desert Island. The paella is the star of the show, and the mojitos are awesome. Reservations required.</li>

                        <h4>Ice Cream & Drinks</h4>

Hands down the best place for ice cream on the island. The line is long, but it's worth it. There are two locations; we recommend the one close to the village green.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/atlantic-brewing-company-bar-harbor" target="_blank">Atlantic Brewing Company</a>, 15 Knox Road Bar Harbor. While Atlantic has a tasting room in downtown Bar Harbor, the Knox Road location is more fun. There's often live music on the weekends and tastings are free; our favorite is Brother Adam Braggart's Ale.</li>
